Project for my university - Build an interface for communicating with a MySQL database having the structure Medics m:n Pacients, using two different technologies.
I added the Consults table in order to link Medics and Pacients.

In this repo is the first implementation, using Java with the Hibernate framework for communcating with the database using built in methods instead of writing SQL queries.

Here I have also tried to make a more dynamic web page by adding jQuery to buttons and for displaying the data from the database.
